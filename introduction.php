                            <p><strong>National Inter-Religious Network Nepal (NIRN Nepal)</strong> on Violence Against Women <strong>(VAW)</strong>, a non-government organization registered in the District Administration Office in Lalitpur on Paush 16, 2065 (Dec. 31, 2008) has been working throughout Nepal in eliminating discrimination on gender, violence against woman in the name of religion and ending child marriage . This network, while giving priority against eliminating violence against women, has been launching other activities such as minimization of HIV AIDS cases and also involved in the establishment of peace and harmony in the society through interfaith activities throughout Nepal. This network organization has member representing more than 25 organizations affiliated. This network aims at cooperating with the people of all faiths working against woman violence, HIV AIDS cases and for promoting peace and harmony in the society.</p>
                            <p>In order to end discrimination prevailing in the Nepalese society in the name of religions and culture, the people representing all faiths have been carrying awareness and advocacy programs giving importance in these fields. If Hinduism has been giving importance, to the dignity of woman, Islam has been giving importance to the equal treatment of men and women.Similarly the importance to the dignity of women is given in Hinduism and Jainism. Islam has also given a dignified place in the society. As such, it can be believed that with the collective efforts of all faiths, negative attitude towards women, discrimination as well violence against women can be ended forever.</p>
                            <p>Even then, for fulfilling their vested interests, women were treated as second citizens in the name of religion and different kind of discriminations, violence, HIV infection have been made against them. This inter faith national network has been established to prove the changes against women as baseless.</p>
